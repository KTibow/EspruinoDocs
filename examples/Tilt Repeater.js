Tilt Hydrometer Repeater
=========================

* KEYWORDS: Tilt,Hydrometer,Tilt Hydrometer,Brew,Brewing,Beer
* USES: Only BLE,TiltHydrometer

![Tilt Repeater](Tilt Repeater.png)

The [Tilt Hydrometer](https://tilthydrometer.com/) is a nice easy way to
get real-time information about the specific gravity and temperature of
beer that you're brewing.

It broadcasts information about your brew to your Phone through Bluetooth LE,
however if you are brewing in Stainless Steel containers or in a garage then
you might have problems getting a high enough signal strength to put your
phone somewhere convenient.

Just upload the code below to any Bluetooth LE capable Espruino board, and
put the board within range of [the Tilt](https://tilthydrometer.com/). It'll
scan for the reading from the Tilt and will then broadcast it at a higher
signal strength, increasing the range.

Uploading
-----

* Use `Save on send` set to `Direct to flash` in the Web IDE settings when uploading
* You will need Espruino 2v01 or later installed on your device
* Copy the code below to the right-hand side of the IDE and click 'Upload'

* APPLOADER_APP: tiltrepeater

Notes
-----

* Baron Brew [sell their own Espruino-based Repeater](https://tilthydrometer.com/blogs/news/extending-range-in-stainless-fermentors-with-the-tilt-repeater-1)
so if you want an easy way to get started or just want to support them, we'd suggest you use that.
* Baron Brew keep the latest version of this software [in their own GitHub Repository](https://github.com/baronbrew/tilt-repeater-js)
* Scanning requires quite a lot of energy and so the repeater requires around 300uA of power on average. When running off a device like [Puck.js](/Puck.js) that
only has a small watch battery, it will flatten in a few weeks. We'd recommend using a rechargeable battery or an external power source instead.
